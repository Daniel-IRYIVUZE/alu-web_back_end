# Python Backend Practice Projects

This repository contains three Python-based learning projects completed as part of the ALU Web Backend curriculum:

1.‚ÄØPython Variable Annotations Project
2.‚ÄØPython Async Project
3.‚ÄØPython Async Comprehension Project

These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of Python type hints and asynchronous programming with asyncio and comprehensions.

## 1. Python Variable Annotations Project

This was the first project I completed and it focuses on applying type annotations in Python to improve code readability, enforce type safety, and build confidence using modern Python practices.

### What I Did

* Annotated variables using built-in types like int, float, str, bool
* Created functions using type hints for arguments and return types
* Applied List, Tuple, Dict, Union, and Callable for more complex structures
* Implemented duck typing for handling generic sequences
* Built higher-order functions that return other functions
* Used mypy to validate types and correct inconsistencies

### Example Tasks

* Adding two floats with annotations
* Concatenating strings with type safety
* Using floor division on floats with annotated return types
* Creating multiplier functions with function return hints
* Safely retrieving values from a dictionary using Union
* Returning typed tuples from a function
* Accepting and returning sequence-like objects using duck typing

### Tools & Concepts

* Python 3.7+ type hinting
* Type checking with mypy
* typing module: List, Tuple, Union, Callable, Any, Optional
* Duck typing concepts in practice

## 2. Python Async Project

This project centers on asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio module and coroutines to manage concurrent tasks efficiently.

### What I Learned

* Writing async functions and using await
* Running coroutines with asyncio
* Managing multiple concurrent tasks
* Measuring asynchronous execution time using time
* Integrating randomness with random.uniform in async workflows

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-basic\_async\_syntax.py   | Waits a random time and returns it                   |
| 1-concurrent\_coroutines.py | Runs multiple coroutines and returns delays in order |
| 2-measure\_runtime.py       | Measures average runtime of wait\_n                  |
| 3-tasks.py                  | Creates an asyncio.Task                              |
| 4-tasks.py                  | Runs multiple async tasks using task function        |

### Requirements Met

* Used Python 3.7 and asyncio
* Followed pycodestyle (v2.5.x)
* Added type hints and documentation
* All files are executable and well-structured

### Resources

* Async IO in Python ‚Äì Real Python
* asyncio ‚Äî Python docs
* random.uniform ‚Äî Python docs

## 3. Python Async Comprehension Project

I have done this project as part of the ALU Web Backend curriculum to understand how asynchronous generators and comprehensions work in Python.

This project helped me learn how to:

* Write asynchronous generators using async def and yield
* Use async comprehensions to collect data from async iterables
* Execute coroutines concurrently using asyncio.gather
* Type-annotate asynchronous functions and generators

---

### Tasks Overview

#### 0. Async Generator

Created a coroutine called async\_generator that yields 10 random floats between 0 and 10, one per second.
üìÅ File: 0-async\_generator.py

---

#### 1. Async Comprehensions

Used an async comprehension to collect 10 random numbers from async\_generator and return them as a list.
üìÅ File: 1-async\_comprehension.py

---

#### 2. Runtime for Four Parallel Comprehensions

Ran async\_comprehension four times in parallel and measured total runtime using asyncio.gather. The total execution time is around 10 seconds since all comprehensions run concurrently.
üìÅ File: 2-measure\_runtime.py

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* Follows pycodestyle (v2.5.x)
* All files are executable and include documentation and type hints
