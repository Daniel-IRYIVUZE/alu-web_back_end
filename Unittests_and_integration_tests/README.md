# Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the principles and practical applications of **unit testing** and **integration testing** using Python's `unittest` framework. It emphasizes the importance of mocking, parameterization, and memoization for effective and efficient test coverage.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I have gained the ability to:
- Differentiate between unit tests and integration tests.
- Apply common testing patterns such as:
  - Mocking functions and properties
  - Parameterizing tests
  - Using fixtures and decorators
- Write clean, well-documented, and type-annotated test files.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7
- `unittest` and `unittest.mock`
- `parameterized` for dynamic test inputs
- `pycodestyle` for code style compliance

## How to Run Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_utils.py
python3 -m unittest test_client.py
````

## Key Concepts Covered

* **Unit Testing:**
  Verifies individual functions like `access_nested_map` and `get_json` with different inputs and edge cases.

* **Integration Testing:**
  Uses mocked HTTP responses and predefined fixtures to simulate real-world API interactions for the `GithubOrgClient` class.

* **Mocking & Patching:**
  External calls (HTTP, database, I/O) are mocked to ensure isolation and determinism in tests.

* **Parameterization:**
  The `@parameterized.expand` and `@parameterized_class` decorators are used to run the same test logic with multiple data sets.
